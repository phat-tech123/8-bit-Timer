# 8 bit Timers (TMR)

## Introduction
This LSI has two units (unit 0 and unit 1) of an on-chip 8-bit timer module that comprise two 8-bit
counter channels, totaling four channels. The 8-bit timer module can be used to count external
events and also be used as a multifunction timer in a variety of applications, such as generation of
counter reset, interrupt requests, and pulse output with a desired duty cycle using a compare-match
signal with two registers.
